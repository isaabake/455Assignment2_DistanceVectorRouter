How to run:
runtest1.bat will open a process for each router in test 1 with correct parameters. The same for test2. If you want to run it against a 
different test, you will need to generate a new batch file to start the processes.

Note: This program requires .NET 4.5 to be installed.

The python script printtables.py works properly and takes as parameters the name of the test directory and optionally which router to print.
The python script changelink.py also works properly and takes 4 parameters: testdir router1 router2 cost

This program uses the config files provided by Dr.Hauser for ease of use. The associated python scripts for generating tests are also functional.
